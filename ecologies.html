					<h4>Sunset Park, Square Dancing and Mental Health</h4>
						<p>I am thinking of examining Leif Ericson Park in Sunset Park, which is heavily populated by Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans. Here, I will observe the space that elderly Chinese / Chinese Americans congregate in, as it is a long held tradition that they come together in the mornings and afternoons to partake in activities such as Chinese square dancing (guǎngchǎng wǔ), tai chi, or even idle chitchat. I want to examine how this tradition may fit in relieving mental stress and mental illness, or in this case, mental illness as it persists in the lives of mainly older elderly Chinese females in its various dormant and suppressed forms, in which it is more likely to go completely unacknowledged. As for the precarity of this situation - for their age range, Chinese Americans reportedly have the highest suicide rate of all females in the United States. </p>
						<p>Along with the dwindling amount of mental health resources for Asians and Asian americans in the United States (in which I will look at Sunset Park / Leif Ericson Park as a microcosm), parks in NYC are historically overcrowded - I want to examine how factors such as overcrowding, noise pollution and public disturbance may (potentially) hinder activities such as square dancing and tai chi.</p>

						<h4>Sunset Park and Ethnic (Chinese) Supermarkets</h4>
							<p>Chinese supermarkets are notorious for being cheaper than chains such as Trader Joe's or Whole Foods, and I want to examine how this both lifts up the immigrant community and harms it. For example, while the low prices appeal to a large amount of people, they may also deter those who are unfamiliar with the quality of the food, harming the livelihood of smaller business owners, especially situated around areas such as Chinatown and Sunset Park in Brooklyn. On a more personal / societal wide scale, this may perpetuate the way other populations (unfamiliar with this culture) see Chinese businesses and restaurants. Not only is there fear from the trade deal that Trump has with China about imported chicken (which poses health concerns due to food contamination and avian flu), but Chinese restaurants have a reputation of receiving low sanitation grades. While these are definitely health hazards, the way these associations affects blue collar immigrants ripples across the community (which are not affiliated with the Chinese government!).</p>
							<p>Food is undoubtedly a financial and cultural cornerstone for the immigrant community and these negative associations harm the financial wellbeing and potential of the community. With the amount of landlord manipulation and overcrowding going on in Sunset Park, these financial needs are more important than ever. I most likely would be conducting my research around Sunset Park in Brooklyn, examining the way people interact with Chinese supermarkets (and potentially restaurants).</p>

						<h4>Charter Buses and Safety in Flushing</h4>
							<p>I want to examine the charter bus industry in Queens - many of the employed drivers have gotten into recent accidents, especially those employed by the Dahlia Group. Even as recently as this September, deaths have occurred due to this negligent culture. It seems that the driver background checks are either not very thorough or just weak, as many have had a history of probation. For example, the lax regulation has hired a driver with a DUI and previous accounts of license suspension.</p> 
							<p>The Dahlia Group is based in Flushing, and I most likely would observe those waiting at normal bus stops and charter bus stops, as well as interview local drivers (both bus or everyday drivers) to make sense of the traffic culture. I will observe how embedded transportation is in our lives and the risks it poses, which definitely is seen as an afterthought in the general population. I want to see how deeply this travel culture informs the environment, and vice versa - how the layout of these sites inform this culture. As for the charter buses, their companies transportation between cities and states at cheap prices, making it an attractive option for the frugal traveller, which seems to come with a steep - and fatal - price.</p>
