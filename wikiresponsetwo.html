				<em>Code</em> in <em>Software Studies: A Lexicon:</em> A Response to <a href="http://composingdigitalmedia.org/f17_dmtp/web/cxi/wiki.html" target="_blank" title="Jade's Response to Ethnocomputing">Jade's piece</a>
			</h4>
			
			<p>After reading Friedrich Kittler's <em>Code</em> and being a current student in <em>Digital Media: Theory and Practice</em>, it occurred to me that this is the most I have ever interacted with code -- not on a surface level (via physical technology and its user-oriented interfaces), but at the fundamental <em>code level</em>. Of course, code has always been there, lining the innards of our technology, defining the way we communicate via technological pathways. Kittler’s description of code as it evolved from the Roman Empire to Morse Code to the Turing Machine had previously seemed archaic and historical to me, the rusty language of history books (no pun intended). </p>
			
			<p>Yet, as a language and as something else entirely, code has always been relevant to the way that we communicate, and as technological innovations continue, code still makes up its foundations. With new media, as Jade mentioned, amateurs and hobbyists can play around with code (again, like in this very class!) and create tidbits of their own content, insofar they have some sort of device. From web development to more “hidden” types of code (and our own encoding and decoding of these technologies), it seems as if the rationalization of information and discovery is linked to code -- which is why code has not yet replaced the need for humans. </p>
			
			<p>Kittler said that “today, technology puts code into the practice of realities, that is to say: it encodes the world”, and while I agree that code’s most obvious and technologically effective form of existence lies with computer and digital technology, I also wonder how it applies to other areas of life, rather than the cut-and-dry stereotype of computer engineers that are locked away in cubicles, furiously typing alphanumerical letters into their computers (which is formed around other types of code). While this is literally code, this technology hasn’t always existed -- what other methods of encodement have come to exist around us all? As the Roman Empire’s language discoveries were what used to be considered code (along with their laws), what will today’s technology become the basis of? It already is well on its path. </p>
			
			<p>While code can be buggy and full of malware, as it grows into its own entity, in the end, it is another form of communication, at the most microscopically technical level. As the way humans fundamentally communicate differ from region to country to language to whatever else, and from a humanistic standpoint, code will never stop evolving. Kittler points out that code, isolated away from humans and allowed to develop on its own, may shroud itself in more mystery than what already exists. Personally, I am not a computer engineer, and unfortunately, I cannot speak for how Kittler's writing fits in these digital mechanisms. In the end, it seems that this piece is less about the functionalities within code itself and more about how it both transcends and segments modern populations and creates venues for meaning, as well as the robotic, rational tech that underscores it and creates these contradictions.</p>
