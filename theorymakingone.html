				<h4>Recreation</h4>
				
					<p>Around the world, middle-aged and senior Chinese populations have been known to gather in hordes to practice activities such as Chinese square dancing (guǎngchǎng wǔ) and tai chi, and this phenomenon has snuck its way onto various news outlets. Public reactions range from these activities being dismissed as noise pollution or a public disturbance to those who marvel at these strange, too-common activities - it's not everyday that you see senior citizens, let alone Asians (who are rather stereotypically known for being obedient) get into trouble with the law. And for what? Dance moves? Some strange, zen-like Chinese ritual?</p>
					
					<p>Rather, it’s important to note the importance of guǎngchǎng wǔ and tai chi in Chinese culture - while there are scientific inconsistencies regarding the overall benefit of traditional chinese medicine and practice - like any form of exercise, these activities do assist in mitigating mental stress or illness, while providing Chinese elders with a consistent social structure. For Chinese Americans and Chinese immigrants in the United States (note: the latter are often in the process of becoming American citizens), the importance of these activities increases exponentially. “Chinatowns”, such as Sunset Park in Brooklyn, form due to the demand for a physical Chinese community within the expanse that is America, and yet alienation and displacement still persist. Elderly Chinese Americans have the highest suicide rate within their age range, yet this fact flies under the radar, as mental illness is notoriously under acknowledged in Asian cultures, and perhaps even more significantly for the elderly Chinese. Daily and weekly communal congregation points give space for Chinese elders to fully engage in meaningful cultural activities and provide a means of physical and mental alleviation, if only for a morning or afternoon.</p>
					
				<h4>Restriction</h4>
				
					<p>New York City parks are notoriously overcrowded, and in Sunset Park, where landlord manipulation continues to limit and shut people out of their private homes, public spaces are crucial. Perhaps this is why there are so many Elderplan and Healthcare facilities in place arount 8th Avenue - they have nowhere else to go. However, this is just a random guess on my part - more observational treks to Sunset Park will be needed. Does the placement of these facilities cause more movement towards the park? Other uncontrollable factors at play include turbulent weather, which acts as a physical barrier to congregational activities - of course, it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that climate change isn’t helping this naturally occurring problem; however, instead of pointing fingers, I want to examine how access and restriction may affect people and their physical bodies. In Brian Massumi’s “Autonomy of Affect”, he states that “the body doesn’t just absorb pulses or discrete stimulations; it infolds contexts, it infolds volitions and cognitions that are nothing if not situated. Intensity is asocial, but not presocial - it includes social elements but mixes them with elements belonging to other levels of functioning and combines them according to different logic.” Seemingly contradictory as these levels of functioning may be, they all exist at an impulse moment, hinging on the environment that the body is in, which in this case, would be Leif Ericson Park and its surrounding neighborhood.</p>
					
				<h4>Process</h4>
				
					<p>I want to examine specific parks in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park, particularly Leif Ericson Park. Leif Ericson Park is in the midst of the Chinese immigrant population, while Sunset Park (the park itself, not the neighborhood) is closer to the Hispanic immigrant population, so my focus will most likely stay on the former. Other spaces I am considering observing are the various MJHS Elderplan facilities located in proximity to Leif Ericson Park; however, this is a bit hazy as I do not want be an intrusive presence. If I am given the okay, I am interested in interviewing the Elderplan residents, as Chinese people live in traditionally multi-generational homes. Although not unheard of, the amount of Elderplan facilities that I spotted was surprising, and as Chinese individuals have a tendency of being distrustful of Western health services, I want to contextually examine Elderplan’s role in Sunset Park’s Chinese community. I plan on interviewing the Chinese elders who practice in these parks, as well as Chinese American or immigrant individuals who happen to be travelling in the area in order to gauge how common or rare these activities may be, or whether the activities have been completely normalized in the minds of the community. I plan on taking audio and video recordings of the park itself and its day to day activities.</p>
					
				<h4>Design</h4>
				
					<p>As my project is focused on Chinese American and immigrant culture and parks as a public space, I want the general theme to be an unravelling of sorts of this cyberspace. I am considering a vertical navigational bar, which mirrors the vertical formation of traditionally Chinese books. I am deliberating between inserting a “symbolic” picture to contrast these header elements with the background and vice versa - I do not want to be overindulgent in combining these elements, as too much Chinese paraphernalia may overshadow the nuances of my project, which is about its integration into these spaces rather than the Chinese culture itself. Other design choices I am currently deliberating upon include the contrast between red and cooler “natural” colors such as green and blue in order to represent the Chinese culture (which honors red as a signifier of luck) and the spaces that may both liberate and confine the practice of the culture, and by extension, their emotional and mental outlets. Ways to represent this color are through pictures of the site and CSS color choices. I am also deliberating whether certain webpages (depending on the topic) could subtly shift in terms of color scheme (for example, a darker sky on a page with darker content). However, I want to make sure it doesn’t seem contrived, as I want to emphasize the everyday life in the parks - for example, I am thinking of recording a time-lapse of activity in the park as a home page.</p>
