				<h4>Chinese Pop Songs, Trash, Signs, and the Color Red</h4>
				
				<p>When documenting Sunset Park through video means, I am particularly interested in the marriage between sight and sound, moving images and the affect of music. As I have seen many elders bring their own portable boom boxes to the park in order to dance together, visually examining the way these Chinese classic pop songs make way for a physical point of congregation is particularly interesting. Other than capturing this on video, I am thinking of taking timelapse videos of the park, if I can figure out how to do so on a DSLR camera, as I feel like this will help the eye take in the daily migration of people to and from the park in one fluid motion. As timelapse videos are usually silent, I may pair this with edited sound clips of the actual park, or perhaps more Chinese classic pop songs.</p>
				
				<p>Whenever I go to Leif Ericson park, I notice trash strewn about, as well as many signs written in Chinese, some of them seeming urgent. After translating some of these signs, a video montage of these clips -- both the signs and the trash around them -- will hopefully prove to be affective in demonstrating the precarity of the park. Along the same vein, as I have also been to the park in times of rain, visually capturing how rain can clear a public park would also be interesting to capture, along with any other elements of nature.</p>
				
				<p>I want to interview some of the elders in the park; however, I am finding it difficult to talk to them, as my Chinese is a bit rusty, and some elders seem to see me as a young nuisance. This ties in to my worry about affecting the ecology in an invasive way, so I am trying to figure out more official ways of interviewing people with ties to this location, such as nearby health services; however, again, they may also be very private.</p>
				
				<p>Other areas I want to capture include the people commuting to and from the 8th Avenue subway station and the supermarkets and businesses in the vicinity. I noticed that many supermarkets give away red plastic bags to stock groceries in, and along with the startling amount of red that the average Sunset Park resident wears, the repeated red color becomes overwhelming, and capturing that via video would definitely have some symbolic resonance with many Chinese Americans and immigrants.</p>
