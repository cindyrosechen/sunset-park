# Sunset Park: Recreation and Restriction
In this independent website, I examine Leif Ericson Park in Sunset Park, Brooklyn in order to assess the role of public parks as a vital recreational force in the Chinese immigrant elder community. I examine Chinese elder mental health through the lens of ecological media theory, supported through on-site research and digital media documentation. This project culminates in a proposed call-for-action to the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation.
Selected and displayed in New York University's mediaWorks_2019 exhibition.
