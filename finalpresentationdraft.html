				<p>For my final presentation, I am mainly thinking of presenting my photos, my writing, and my video (all on my website, of course). I believe that these are the most tangible forms of media  on my website -- the audio seems a bit more abstract -- and work best in immediately demonstrating the precarity of my project. As this website mainly focuses on identifying and vitalizing the going-ons of Leif Ericson park and its cultural and social connotations (rather than hard, analytical research), it definitely seems like a pitch for a larger, more tactical project -- for example, a smaller portion of people that can aid in calling for Asian American healthcare access, environmental preservation of New York City Public Parks, or an activist group focused on fighting gentrification and housing development.</p>
				
				<p>As of now, I would like to pitch this project to some sort of non-profit organization as a source of awareness and empathy, and to call a deeper investigation into the various issues I touched upon in this project. At this point, I do not think I will be asking for grant, but more likely aiming to collaborate with an organization in order to aid their overall strategies of support. In this case, I would like to pitch it to a more general Chinese American interest group that aims to improve quality of life for Asian Americans, especially in regards to mental health, as it is so underacknowledged in the Chinese culture. This would most likely mean working with groups that focus on integrating Chinese immigrants and their families, as well as young Chinese American and immigrant kids, and I think focusing on family and socializing is imperative. Mental health issues are incredibly individualized, and one-on-one (or just more specific) focus on the people affected by these cross-cultural issues seems to be the way to go.</p>
