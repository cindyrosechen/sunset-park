				<h4><em>software studies: a lexicon</em>, from <em>interface</em> to <em>perl</em></h4>
				
				<p>I grew up in Silicon Valley in Northern California, smack dab in the middle of computer science and engineering utopia. When I was young, I was genuinely under the impression that nearly all adults became computer engineers, and that it was one of the most common, default fields to go into -- after all, my parents were (and are) software engineers, my best friends’ parents were software engineers, <em>everyone was an engineer</em>. If they weren’t an engineer, they were a doctor or some form of data analyst. This is not an exaggeration. In this Silicon Valley bubble, it just wasn’t something I gave much thought (and in retrospect, this is only due to the privilege I had, growing up in such a STEM-oriented area). While I was aware of the existence of humanities and arts, it seemed a world away from me, a world that I consumed daily through countless books, art, and television. Fun media and entertainment, not the drudgery of <em>Adulthood</em>.</p>
					
				<p>Of course, this assumption quickly dissolved in middle and high school, and early on, I pigeonholed the entire field of computer science as boring and tedious, a job where someone is inevitably locked away in a cubicle, slaving under a harness of code. This had nothing to do with the reality of my parent’s lives, and more to do with my infatuation with media. One incredibly unnuanced view became another, equally as unnuanced view of computer science. Reading Matthew Fuller’s <i>Software Studies: A Lexicon</i>, a compilation of short essays on the mechanical, digital and philosophical nature of technology, reminded me of how <i>rich</i> this field is, and how rapidly technology has and continues to evolve -- and what this means for humanity, as dramatic as that sounds. Media and technology are irrevocably linked together, and not only have these forms of analog and digital technology seeped into the daily mundanities of our lives, but we are becoming wholly dependent on them. No matter what field you go into, you cannot get away from technology. Not that you would want to.</p>
				
				<p>Humans, in their constant effort to toil away in hopes of some productive award, affect the logic and rationality implicit in computer science -- it manifests in the things we invent and create and the technology that we deem as consumable and useful. Sociopolitical institutions -- created and systematically put into effect by humans -- are maintained by the technology that we use, and while technology has the enormous capability to upset these balances of power, its production and distribution are still handled under an established hierarchy, and we are content to marvel at the “cool-ness” of trendy new gadgets and at most, critique the interface of the new iPhone, myself included. We tend to see technology as a hugely helpful supplementary product built to aid us and view ourselves as the sole active agents in our own life, which shields us from the intentions that may be coded into the everyday products that we use. We rely on social media to validate our own existence and individually leave behind a quantifiable, if potentially harmful, digital footprint. Our memories are proven through photos and videos online, and while there is an outspoken population that steadfastly refuses to buy into this “millennial” madness, whose fault is it really? Millennials are but the product of our previous societies (and we're trying the hardest we can!) -- as Warren Sack points out in <i>Memory</i>, “What makes this tight coupling between human memory and computer memory seem plausible? Why might computer memory be seen as “the most viable” model of human memory?”</p>
				
				<p>Sack then mentions that “to untangle this belief of cognitive science it is necessary to remember that before computers were machines, they were human, usually women. For over two hundred years, these women -- these computers -- worked together in groups compiling tables of statistics, tables of trigonometric functions, tables of logarithms.” When I read this passage, it felt like a jolt to my memory (hah) -- last winter, I watched the movie <i>Hidden Figures</i>, which was a biographical drama film precisely about these women computers. <i>Software Studies</i> can sometimes can go so in-depth about certain technical loops and code that the average individual may not be able to grasp its entire meaning, making the content, while undoubtedly important, a bit remote, and <i>Hidden Figures</i> reminded me that the content was in actuality, very close to real life matters. Although <i>Hidden Figures</i> is a media portrayal of a real life event (that took a few liberties with the source material) and serves to tell an incredibly vital moment in history that few people knew about, it’s interesting to examine this loop that media and technology takes us on. For example -- in this case, humans make technology, technology makes life more efficient, money is made, and media is created to celebrate this technology that is made, people pay money to view this media / entertainment, which then informs people more about the technology that allowed its initial creation. Perhaps the audiences that view this media are prompted to find more media of a similar subject matter, or become interested in similar technologies, but the influence that media and technology has on us in total is undeniable.</p>
				
				<p>Of course, these may seem like obvious observations, but it seems similar to the idea of <em>feedback</em>, which is a central theme that runs throughout <i>Software Studies</i>. Feedback is crucial to the user interfaces that we interact with, as well as the programming interfaces that run behind the scenes. The code and language used to build these platforms rely on the notion of feedback to make things happen, whether theses uses are functional or creative. Just as I am giving literal feedback about <i>Software Studies</i> and encoding this text into HTML in order for it to be readable for you, who is reading this text, I am able to transmit this information because of the technology that enables me to do so. Embedding this technology education into our curriculum and interacting with it seems necessary in our current society, and <i>Software Studies</i> is a crucial resource that necessitates this critical thinking.</p>
