				<h4>Who am I?</h4>
				
				<ul>
					<li>I am junior at New York University that has volunteered at various Chinese community centers in the past, particularly those that aim to integrate Chinese senior residents and elders into the American community.</li>
					<li>At the moment, I am working directly at a Chinese Daycare center in Brooklyn for senior residents, in which I help organize indoor and outdoor activities for them to participate in.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Who is the audience?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>I am going directly to the <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/leif-ericson-park/" title="Sunset Park Blog Post" target="_blank">New York City Department of Parks and Recreation</a> -- in the end, this park falls under their jurisdiction. From their website, it is not immediately clear if there is a subsection dedicated to Brooklyn, or even the more specific Sunset Park area; therefore, for now, I am still directing this presentation towards them.</li>
					
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Background + Statistics</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Everyday, hundreds of Chinese Americans and Chinese immigrants commute from Sunset Park to the various boroughs of New York City. Located in the southwestern region of Brooklyn, above 7th Avenue, Sunset Park contains one of the many “Chinatowns” of New York City.</li>
					<li>According to macaulay.cuny.edu, with a population of about 129,000 people, Sunset Park is more than twice as dense as New York City itself.</li>
					<li>Its housing units and public parks are notoriously overcrowded, and are subject to gentrification and rampant landlord manipulation.</li>
					<li>Sunset Park is home to about 45,000 Chinese speaking residents, including about 3,000 senior residents.</li>
					<li>In 2015, studies showed that 27% of adults in Sunset Park had no health insurance; furthermore, Chinese mental health continues to be culturally stigmatized.</li>
					<li>Alongside this elder influx, an increasing amount of healthcare and daycare centers for Chinese elders have been cropping up around these neighborhoods.</li>
					<li>These healthcare centers often help organize park activities to keep elders on their feet. From cards to Chinese music to square dancing, these activities oftentimes continue well into the nighttime.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>Why It Matters</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>According to the <em>National Center for Biotechnology Information</em>, “The Chinese elderly population has a higher prevalence of suicide than the general population. The over-65 age group has the highest rate of completed suicide...Where China has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, Chinese Americans over the age of 65 have the highest rate of completed suicide in the U.S. over any other racial groups nationwide.”</li>
					<li>Leif Ericson, a park located between 66th and 67th Street, acts as a shared space in which Chinese elders come together to socialize and partake in cultural activities. Many come here nearly everyday, and this activity has become embedded into their lifestyles. A cornerstone of their every day lives, such activities are vital when maintaining physical and mental health.</li>
					<li>However, it is isn’t always this easy. Like all other parks in New York City, Leif Ericson is subject to overcrowding, trash pollution, and turbulent weather, all of which can drive out elders from this space. </li>
					<li>During the colder months, elder park participation decreases in capacity, and as Sunset Park is already overpopulated, buildings that hold indoor recreational activities don't have a realistic amount of space to accommodate all  who are in need of an outlet.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>An Interview</h4>

				<h4>Proposal</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>While parks such as Leif Ericson are undoubtedly important, they shouldn’t be one of the few sources of alleviation for Chinese seniors. Physical and mental healthcare are incredibly complex issues, and it is necessary to address this in order to improve their quality of life.</li>
					<li>Despite Sunset Park’s overcrowdedness, these shared public parks should be positively recognized for what they are -- a safe haven for Chinese elders. While the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation has championed admirable causes in Leif Ericson Park, such as the <em>It's My Park!</em> environmental initiative; however, as positive as it is, this is still a city-wide campaign, and there seems to be a lack of localized campaigns that focus specifcally on Sunset Park.</li>
					<li>I propose that the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation should work together with local Chinese Daycares and Healthcare Centers in order to provide an increased amount of recreational programs that elders can participate in -- not only in Leif Ericson Park, but in government facilitated indoor buildings within the vicinity of 8th Avenue, <em>especially</em> when the air turns frigid, the weather turns intolerable, and the streets become clogged with trash.</li>
					<li>Changing the infrastructure of the way health care facilities treat and interact with elder residents, especially immigrants, is a deeply important task that will take years of reformation.</li>
					<li>For now, I believe that the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation can have a much more immediate impact on the lives of elders. It can help this community simply by providing a clean space for these recreational events to happen more regularly (i.e. one event a week), and thus, providing more venues for them to actively congregate. </li>
					<li>Pre-existing Chinese Daycare centers can help inform the program choices (i.e. dance, mahjiang, festival celebration, potlucks). Having events in public indoor spaces such as city hall would also provide much-needed information that may help Chinese residents familiarize themselves with the infrastructure of American society.</li>
