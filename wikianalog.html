				<em>Analog</em> in <em>Software Studies: A Lexicon:</em> The Last Decade
			</h4>
			<p>In Matthew Fuller's book <em>Software Studies: A Lexicon</em>, in the <em>Analog</em> chapter, Derek Robinson strives to highlight the importance of analog in the global development of technology -- not just as a form of technology but as a scientific philosophy in understanding the world, and understanding our understanding of the world and the complex systems that we are codependent on. He begins to do so by delving into the theory of analog technology and electrical computing and the tangibilization of previously more abstract concepts such as math and physics. Rooted and intertwined with historical events (which aided its development) such as the many wars over the past two century -- notably World War II and the Vietnam -- the weaponization of such technology gave way to public acceptance about these computing hardware’s relevancy, and like many other forms of technology, began to be commercialized and commodified.</p>
			
			<p>Robinson emphasizes the importance of <em><strong>feedback</strong></em> in analog technology’s success, and the importance of understanding how functions can build off and feed into each other and prompt these returns to equilibrium. Public understanding of negative feedback (and the way it relates to bodily functions such as homeostasis) made it become a more mundane concept, and while revolutionary at the time (think the Seinfeld Effect), it quickly felt outdated, like old news. However, at the time of publishing, Robinson noted that analog forms of technology may indeed be coming back, with the ironic push of digital technology. 
			</p>
			
			<p>When considering feedback itself, is this not what Robinson was trying to convey? The return to equilibrium, the unceasing and interrelated effects of technology on other technology, technology as it runs itself, humans and technology, and all the miniscule interactions in between? The unceasing cross-efforts of hundreds of fields of studies, from electrical engineering to physics to art to financial stocks, when combined together, continue to have lasting impacts on each other. For example, Robinson points out visual analog depictions of financial shock and equilibrium, which seems to demonstrate these points, and while Robinson was unsure of analog’s role in the future, it seems as if he was somewhat right -- both in its relevancy and its questionable role in significantly impacting the future.
			</p>
			<h4>Analog Now</h4>
			<p>
			Of course, when looking at “analog” in the past 10 years, one has to wonder what context it is brought up in. Robinson himself is a black humour novelist, with a focus on military aviation -- it makes sense that his past focus on “analog” was deeply embedded in war studies. Yet with social media booming as it is now, while it may seem like a much more superficial topic, it is as deeply relevant to the public understanding of analog as it exists today. The general public does not understand the computational power of analog machinery and its differences from digital technology (mostly, they will see it through consumable technology - for example, analog clocks VS. digital), and its lack of public visibility makes it hard to reintroduce into the mainstream. With social media's ties to popular culture being as effective as it is (see: Russia’s fake news and targeted ads to elect Donald Trump, its role in provoking North Korea’s Kim Jong Un), one has to wonder about the effect that the resurgence of retro (and much of the time, analog) trends will have on the development of technology, as well as the general public’s understanding of technology.</p>
			
			<p>From polaroid cameras to vinyl records to hemp culture to 35mm film, various subcultures take a great amount of pride in disconnecting from social media and reconnecting with organic elements. Analog technology, which is still very much technology, often falls underneath this berth. Pseudo-retro aficionados (see: new polaroid cameras) to genuine antique lovers mostly seem to do so out not to promote analog technology in itself (most of them probably own smartphones), but due to the aesthetic of this retro-technology. A smaller portion of them will have done their research and enjoy certain mediums, for example, for the less compressed format of vinyls. When looking at these superficial feedback loops, digital technology serves to promote the appeal of these analog technologies, creating this faux public equilibrium of analog technology as a hobby to possibly partake in, rather than a technology with the ability to mediate our lives. This is neither a positive or a negative thing -- it simply is. Treating it as inherently superior or inferior would seem to devalue what analog technology is at its core, which is another form of technology that is better suited for some tasks than others. As is the case with digital technology, which will doubtlessly come up in this conversation.
			</p>
			<p>
			Of course, analog technology is still functioning behind the scene in more discrete ways, as scientists attempt to coax its most efficient parts to complement digital technology. <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/analog-computing-organs-organisms-0620" target="_blank">Scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a> have extolled analog methods when combining biological subcomponents with machinery and its unfailing accuracy, despite the timesuck that is inevitably introduced when coding and compiling it. Unlike the binary code of digital, when done right, its effects are immediate and ultimate. Yet as of now, while it is still running through the minds of computer scientists and experts (or in those whose livelihood and work depend on the fundamental processing of these elements), the general public does not seem to be observing analog technology en masse for its daily benefits. If feedback is built off of these codependent relationships, in terms of mindless efficiency, digital technology has monopolized these efforts, as tech and marketing startups continue to climb over one another to harness yet another facet of digital technology.</p>
			
			<p>While scientific labs are continually interested in the development of these larger computing machines, capitalist markets seem to be wholly focused on the digital, which is providing its own positive feedback -- the digital becomes even more digital, fracturing into VR experiences and other sensory and information based immersive experiences. These demographics seem far more interested in consuming, and those who are looking to create successfully can only do so on publicly consumable level. The average worker doesn’t have time or effort to spare to fundamentally change the public’s perception and usage (and technology capacity) of analog technology. As for now, these scientists will continue to work on these analog technologies in the background, and analog technology will work alongside and help uplift the digital landscape. This is where the roots of technology lay two centuries ago, and hopefully, equilibrium will eventually be somewhat restored -- not for the benefit of analog technology as a whole, but to increase technology’s evolution and efficiency in the most effective way possible.
