				<em>Ethnocomputing</em> in <em>Software Studies: A Lexicon:</em> A Response to <a href="http://composingdigitalmedia.org/f17_dmtp/web/ash/ethnocomputingupdated.html" target="_blank" title="Amy's Response to Ethnocomputing">Amy's piece</a>
			</h4>
			
			<p>After reading Ron Eglash and Matti Tedre's <em>Ethnocomputing</em>, I agree with Amy on many points -- social media activism and the general increasing ambiguity of digital borders make the topic of ethnocomputing all the more relevant today. While Eglash and Tedre don’t focus much on social media itself and are more focused on general technology (and the coding interfaces that they are created with), since 2008, social media has become more relevant. Nearly a decade later, if you are privileged enough to be an American, it sometimes seems impossible to escape the reach of social media, and many people do not want to.</p>
			
			<p>New generations (in this case, more likely Western) are growing up in this social media influenced world, with the assumption that these platforms are available to everyone with internet access, a laptop, or a mobile device. New generations see digital technology as an expected extension of their identity. The power of such media can be good -- those who are not technological scientists or experts can contribute their own content to the growing online conversation, and can help entertain and educate (or alternatively, spread obfuscating facts) audiences in a way that past generations weren’t able to. Recent social media campaigns have triggered movements and even revolutions, encouraging people to question everything, encouraging online discourse. On the darker side, while the outspoken become more outspoken and the hesitant may be given a voice, the seeming ubiquity of content makes it all the more easy to mask and strengthen any silence that exists.</p>
			
			<p>However, as Eglash and Tedre rightfully point out, Western communities tend to forget about other countries’ situations (and even minority populations' in their own countries) -- that many people do not have the money, access, or time to be on this playing field. As Amy points out, in terms of the working field, minorities are less likely to enter STEM fields, and concurrently are more likely to lead lower qualities of life. Going back to Eglash and Tedre’s examples and the effort of certain groups to promote locally-based technologies that work to empower marginalized groups, I agree that people should have a “common goal...to bring the historical and societal constructions of the computational practices of different cultural groups to bear on technological design and practice.” (Eglash and Tedre) However, while this is ideal, actively implementing this mindset amongst people is another problem.
			</p>
			
			<p>Data, code, and technology will continue to evolve, and each modification affects the others at a fundamental level. The increased visibility of social media oversimplifies the technical complexity and sociopolitical connotations behind these technologies. The humanity that enters these layers of code (and its aforementioned ubiquity) make it easier for individuals and communities to make mistakes and have its effect cascade into other parts of the world, all without it being obvious. For now, it seems that we have to be as mindful as possible and cognizant of our digital footprint -- but will that ever be enough?</p>
