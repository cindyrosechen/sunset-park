				<h4>Lifelong Learning</h4>
					
				<p><strong>DEFINITION: </strong>The unending process of learning, in which education takes place beyond the classroom. Rather, comprehensive learning builds with experiences and time, and affects you in profoundly personal ways that help construct and even question the foundations of your knowledge and place in the world.</p>

				
				<p><strong>PITCH: </strong>We are a non-profit university with a top-notch global reputation, and as a pioneer of innovative, well-rounded education, we are excited to introduce a new special program for those who are eager and bold enough to pursue this road. As you guys know, we aim to provide the highest quality of education, and we are going to admit -- simple rote memorization and methodical learning can be improved upon. As students at our university, there is so much more to your lives than the classroom, and the experiences that have shaped you and informed your future decisions have taught you invaluable lessons.</p> 
				
				<p>We want to harness and reconfigure the way you conduct your life at this university, and making it so every facet of your life, including your experiences outside of the traditional “classroom”, is turned into a productive moment of self-growth. As far as we know, this is the most innovative and immersive program that has ever been suggested, and the eboard as decided to provide all the means for support that you’ll ever need. As obviously, we, an institution, know better than puny individuals, we can completely influence the way our students build their knowledge and thus the rest of their life decisions, and positively inform the next generation of future business leaders and artistic creators. For only 200k a year, we provide a specialized dorm and classroom environment, complete with a minisphere of bustling markets and events -- you never have to leave. Your mind will completely molded by us for a price only slightly more expensive than our normal tuition!</p>
				
				<p>Think of it as a more productive, more expensive study abroad on campus, in which you can seamlessly become a part of a global networked community, ergo <em>a true citizen of the world</em>.</p>
				
				<h4>Mythologize Decision Making</h4>
				
				<p><strong>DEFINITION: </strong> This chapter discusses the contextual and subjective ambiguity that comes with human-led decision making. Fuller and Goffey point out the need for modelled organizational support systems and strategies, which base decision making off trusted benchmarks in complex systems (i.e. a government). The illusion of objectivity and reliability that these systems instill (and their logical quantifiability) creates a hierarchal means of knowledge prioritization. Now, this is done through the interaction of a presupposed environment with a “thing” or “artifact” (technology) that makes the decision support system (DSS) user friendly and convenient to mediate decisions through. Two dimensional as it may be, it is deemed more professional and efficient.</p>

				<p><strong>PITCH: </strong>We’re a government funded newspaper that writes the truth, and the truth only. On our weekly publishings, we cover all kinds of news from around the globe -- politics, economics, arts and entertainment, and sports. Every person should subscribe to us because we are the one's that you should trust, we are the one's that will answer all your questions and educate you on everything that goes on in the world. Since you will be informed of the actual facts and given honest figures, you will be able to form a legitimate opinion. </p>
				
				<p>We have compiled an online database that utilizes the hard statistics of the world and quantifies it for you. After all -- the point of history is to make sure mistakes aren’t repeated, and everyday, new history is made. Using our 100% reliable and accurate algorithm, if you type in a problem you have into our engine, we will be able to predict what option will give you the most beneficial outcome. We will reach out to and collaborate with Google in order to access their extensive data collection, and not only will it be easier for you to live life -- <em>just do what you're told</em> -- with our handy algorithm, we can ensure you the best quality of life considering the circumstances that you already in. This will be easily accessible through a built-in microchip that we can implant in you (or for those hesitant to commit, a temporarily detachable clip), and thus, keep you literally "plugged in" to the world, which we have rationalized for you. Think of it like a SD Card that safeguards your future.</p>
				
				<em><p>If you trust us, then you’ll trust yourself.</p></em>
