				<h4>sound, noise, and the music in between</h4>
					<p>Mandarin and Cantonese voices appear en masse at the MTA stop in Union Square, and increase in frequency and intensity when aboard the N Train towards Brooklyn. After reaching the 8th Ave station, the blue sky above an indication of when to get off, the Chinese voices blend in with those of Sunset Park, complemented by the hustle of a road filled with Chinese supermarkets.</p>
					
					<p>When examining the soundscape of Sunset Park, editing together the change in audible tones between Manhattan and Sunset Park would highlight the density of the latter's immigrant and POC population. In addition, I would include soundbites of the subway soundscape as well (in both 14th St and 8th Ave stations), as this transitory space helps create a common thread between the two geographic locations, indicating that these spaces are not to be seen as isolated from one another, but rather a flow of bodies and cultures from one space to the next. I mostly expect train rumbles and snippets of conversation and wind, and am looking forward how the two soundscapes blend into one another.</p>
					
					<p>In terms of other areas of passive audio recording, Leif Ericson Park serves as a rich site -- filled with demographics that range from five to seventy in age, the intermixture of these age groups would be easily identifiable through the recording. Mandarin, English, and Spanish banter conglomerate in different areas of the park, and at times, Chinese elders bring in their personal boomboxes, creating an almost bubble-like atmosphere, filled to the brim with classic Chinese pop songs. The sound of basketballs rebounding against concrete fill in the empty spaces; the park is nothing if not vibrant.</p>
					
					<p>Furthermore, I want to conduct interviews with Chinese immigrant and Chinese American elders in order to gauge their feelings regarding this park. In this case, oral communication seems to be the most useful way of capturing the ephemeral and temporal emotion that comes from being in the park. I also want to conduct interviews with those who are less attached to this park, whom I will most likely find walking around areas that are not the park -- this way I can calculate the differences in backgrounds and opinions. This will help me flesh out a more three-dimensional picture of the ecology that exists as Sunset Park and the "bounded" places in between (in the sense that these places can never be affectively bounded).</p>
					
					<p>I am also interested in acting as a Sunset Park resident myself, going through the motions of grocery shopping and recreational activities, all while recording my interactions. Ideally, my role as an actant in this ecology would not be overtly out of place -- this is a delicate thing to approach and/or control, and I am aiming to keep this lowkey. Another area I could explore includes local restaurants and local dance schools. For the former, I want to potentially examine the noise level in varying classes of restaurants, such as "fast food Chinese" vs. a more expensive place, perhaps interviewing workers and customers (maybe to examine class differences). For the latter, I could try to determine what these closeby experts make of activities such as Square Dancing.</p>
					
					<p>I am especially interested in the role of music in Sunset Park, as I have seen concert flyers for Chinese artists tacked onto buildings and heard Chinese songs blasted within parks. As this music enables forms of dance, while I am still hazy on the details, I want to focus on its relevance to the everyday life of Sunset Park, as music is definitively one of of the most affective aural elements that exist in the world.</p>
					
					<p>Tonally and aesthetically, I am doing my best to not force a tone, as I want these soundbites to create an atmosphere of its own (as opposed to creating one dark or light or whimsical in tone). In terms of passive recording, I don’t want to intrude too much (at most, I would want the most of my direct involvement to be through interviewing others). I want it to have an air of discovery and documentation.</p>
					
					<p>Furthermore, I am concerned about the prevalence of wind and other climate elements that may drown out the human voices, as well as my own personal movement. When taking NYU’s sound recording equipment to Sunset Park, I noticed that the movement of my own hand and the rustle of my clothing sometimes got in the way of the outside noises (as did the the wind, which sounded louder in the recordings than it actually was in reality).</p>
					
					<p>(Note: However, I want to consider devoting a section to the noise of natural elements - edited soundclips of rain, wind, leaves, and maybe emphasize the way they can be potentially precarious.)</p>
